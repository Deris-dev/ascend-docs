# Saison

The **Season System** adds a new dynamic to the bot by resetting ranks every 60 days. Each season allows everyone to start fresh while rewarding members based on their final rank from the previous season.

> Seasons give all members a chance to shine again and climb the global leaderboard!

### Season Duration

* A season lasts **up to 60 days**.
* At the end of each season, **all ranks are reset** across all servers.

### Rank Reset

At the start of each season, members are reset to specific ranks based on their final rank from the previous season:

| Final Rank (Previous Season) | New Rank (Start of Season) |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Master**                   | **Gold 1**                 |
| **Diamond**                  | **Silver 1**               |
| **Other Ranks**              | **Bronze 1**               |

{% hint style="warning" %}
The rank reset is global and applies to all servers using the bot.
{% endhint %}

### Global Seasons and Leaderboard

Seasons are the same across **all servers**:

* A **global leaderboard** allows members to compare their performance across all servers using the bot.
* The season reset is universal, meaning **all bot users are reset at the same time**.

### Season Rewards

At the end of each season, **rewards** are distributed based on each memberâ€™s final rank. These rewards are automatically granted at the start of the new season.

### Starting a New Season

The new season will launch **automatically** on the scheduled date and time.\
To check the exact date and time, use the `/season` command.

When a new season begins:

1. **Old rank roles** (from the previous season) **are not deleted** automatically.
   * You can keep them if you want to track past seasons.
   * If you prefer to clean up, you can manually remove them.
2. To **reconfigure** the roles for the new season, run `/settings > Ranks > Setup Ranks`.
   * All **new roles** will be created and **automatically assigned** to each rank for the new season.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you want to avoid confusion between old and new roles, consider renaming or deleting outdated roles before creating new ones.
{% endhint %}
