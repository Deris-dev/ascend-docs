# Streaks (Flames)

**Streaks (Flames)** reward your daily activity on the Discord server. By maintaining a consecutive series of interaction days (sent messages), you can accumulate RP while unlocking multipliers at specific milestones.

The longer your streak, the greater your rewards thanks to a bonus multiplier!

### How Do Streaks Work?

1. **Daily Interaction**: Each day you send a message, you earn a **streak point**.
2. **Visible Streak**: Your streak becomes visible after **3 consecutive days of activity**.
3. **Reset**: If you miss a day, your streak resets to **zero**.

### Streak Rewards

Each day you earn a streak point, you receive a randomly determined RP reward based on the following probabilities:

* **80%** chance to earn **10 RP**
* **15%** chance to earn **20 RP**
* **5%** chance to earn **50 RP**

### Streak Multipliers

In addition to base rewards, a **multiplier** is applied to your RP gains depending on your streak length (number of flames). Here are the multiplier thresholds:

| Streak Length | Multiplier |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| **0 days**    | x0         |
| **3 days**    | x1.0       |
| **25 days**   | x1.2       |
| **50 days**   | x1.5       |
| **100 days**  | x2.0       |
| **200 days**  | x3.0       |
| **500 days**  | x5.0       |

> Example: If you have a 100-day streak and earn 10 RP, the x2.0 multiplier applies, and you receive **20 RP in total**.

### Streak Reset

If you miss a day without interaction, your streak drops to **zero**. You lose the associated multiplier and must start accumulating flames again.

### Example Progression

* **Day 1**: You send a message → 0 RP earned. Multiplier x0 → Total: 0 RP.
* **Day 3**: Your streak reaches **3 days** and becomes visible. You earn 10 RP with a x1.0 multiplier → Total: 10 RP.
* **Day 50**: You reach 50 days. You earn 10 RP with a x1.5 multiplier → Total: 15 RP.
* **Day 100**: You reach 100 days. You earn 10 RP with a x2.0 multiplier → Total: 20 RP.

#### **What Happens If I Miss a Day?**

Your streak resets to **zero**, and you lose your multiplier. You will need to start over to regain flames and unlock multipliers again.

#### **Can I Exceed 500 Days?**

Yes, you can continue your streak beyond 500 days, but the multiplier remains at x5.0.

#### **How Is RP Calculated?**

RP is calculated based on a random reward (10, 20, or 50 RP) multiplied by the multiplier corresponding to your streak.

#### **How Can I Check My Streak Count?**

Your streak count becomes visible on the server once you reach **3 consecutive days of activity** via the `/rank` command.
