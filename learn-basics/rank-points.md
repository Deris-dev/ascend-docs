# Rank Points (RP)

**Rank Points (RP)** are at the core of the progression system. You can earn RP by being active on your Discord server and participating in various ways.

### How to Earn RP?

1. **Messages**: Each message sent grants you RP.
2. **Reactions**: Adding reactions to messages (or receiving them) also earns you RP.
3. **Voice**: Spending time in voice channels generates RP based on duration.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each RP earning method (messages, reactions, voice) has its own daily limit.
{% endhint %}

### Daily RP Limit

To prevent members from ranking up too quickly, a **daily RP limit** applies to your activities:

* Messages: Independent limit.
* Reactions: Independent limit.
* Voice: Independent limit.

You can use the `/check` command to monitor your progress and see if you've reached your limit for each category.

### Additional RP Rewards

You can also earn bonus RP in specific situations:

* **Major bot updates**: If you're on the bot's official server, a code will be available for 24 hours after an update. Use the `/claim` command to redeem it.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Warning: The `/claim` command can only be used on one server. Make sure to select the correct server before using it.
{% endhint %}

* **Special events**: Participate in events organized on the official server to earn RP codes.
* **YouTube**: Watch videos from the **StevenTed** YouTube channel, where exclusive RP codes may be shared.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Important: RP codes must be redeemed quickly as they have a limited validity period.
{% endhint %}

### Inactivity and RP Loss

If you remain inactive on the server (no interactions), you will lose RP every **24 hours**. The loss is calculated as a percentage of your current RP, which can cause you to drop in rank.

**Example:** If you have 1,000 RP and become inactive, you will lose a percentage of your 1,000 RP at the next check.

### Inactivity for Higher Ranks

Once you reach the highest rank (Master), inactivity checks become more frequent:

* **+3,000 RP**: Check every **16 hours**.
* **+4,000 RP**: Check every **10 hours**.
* **+5,000 RP**: Check every **7 hours**.
* **+6,000 RP**: Check every **5 hours**.
* **+7,000 RP**: Check every **3 hours**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The higher your rank, the more important it is to stay active to avoid losing RP.

#### **How Can I Check If I've Reached My Daily Limit?**

Use the `/check` command to view your current limits for each activity.

#### **Are RP Shared Across Different Servers?**

No, your RP are unique to each server. Your progression depends on your activity within that specific server.

#### **What Happens If I Lose RP Due to Inactivity?**

You may drop in rank if your RP loss brings you below the required threshold for your current rank.

#### **Can I Use Multiple RP Codes?**

Yes, as long as they are still valid, you can use multiple RP codes to accumulate bonus points. However, each code can only be redeemed once.

#### **Can I Use the Same Code on Multiple Servers?**

No, a `/claim` code can only be used on **one server**. Make sure to select the correct server before using it.
