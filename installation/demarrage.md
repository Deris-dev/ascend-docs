# Let's start

This page will guide you step by step on how to add the bot to your Discord server and start using it.\
Make sure you have the necessary permissions on your server before getting started!

## **Step 1: Inviting the Bot**

* Click on this link to invite the bot: [**Bot Invitation Link**](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1312924786451812413)
* Select the server where you want to add the bot (you must have the **"Manage Server"** permission).
* Click **Continue**, then review the permissions requested by the bot.
* Click **Authorize** to add the bot to your server.
* Complete the CAPTCHA verification if required.

## **Step 2: Basic Setup**

Once the bot is added, it will appear online on your server. Here’s what you need to do first:

**Set up permissions:**

* Ensure the bot has the necessary permissions to manage roles and messages.
* Place the bot’s role **above** other roles so it can assign ranks.

**Initial configuration:**

Use the following command to quickly set up the bot:

```
/settings > Ranks > Setup Ranks
```

* This will automatically generate rank roles for your server.
* The bot **does not** require the "Administrator" permission, but make sure it has **"View Channel"** access in the channels where it should track RP.

## **Step 3: Check Key Settings**

Configure the essential channels using `/settings`:

* **Notification Channel:** Choose where rank-up notifications will be sent.
* **Event Channel:** Define the channel for event notifications.
* **Log Channel:** Set where logs of RP gained and lost will be displayed.
* **Event Role:** Assign a specific role for events if needed via `/settings`.

## **Step 4: Explore the Commands**

Here are some useful commands to get started:

* `/check` → View your RP, rank, and daily limits.
* `/leaderboard` → Check the rankings.
