# Notification Channel

The **"Notification Channel"** option allows you to define which channel on your Discord server will receive **rank-up** notifications. These notifications help celebrate member progression and make your server more engaging.

### **How to Configure the Notification Channel?**

1. Use the `/settings` command and select **Notification Channel**.
2. In the dropdown menu, choose the channel where you want rank-up notifications to be sent.

### **How It Works**

* Once configured, all **rank-up** notifications will be sent to the selected channel.
* If no channel is configured, notifications will be sent to the last channel where the member interacted.

### **What Happens If I Don’t Configure a Channel?**

If no notification channel is set, rank-up messages will be sent in the **last channel where the member interacted**.

### **Can Notifications Be Disabled?**

Yes, you can disable rank notifications in the settings using the `/settings` command → **Rank Notifications Channel**.
