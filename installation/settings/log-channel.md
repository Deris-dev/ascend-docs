# Log Channel

The **"Log Channel"** option allows you to define which channel on your Discord server will receive logs. These logs display only the number of **RP gained or lost** by your members based on their activity.

### **How to Set a Log Channel?**

1. Access the `/settings` command and select **Logs Channel**.
2. In the dropdown menu, choose the channel on your server where the logs will be displayed.
3. Click **Save** to confirm your choice.

Once the channel is configured, the bot will automatically send information about RP gained or lost by your members in that channel.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can choose the display style of the logs between Embed and Simple Message. [Learn how to customize the log style](type-de-logs.md).

#### **What happens if I donâ€™t set a log channel?**

Without configuration, RP information will not be recorded in any channel. You will need to define a log channel to use this feature.

#### **Can the logs display anything other than RP gained or lost?**

No, the logs are specifically designed to track the RP progression of members.

#### **Can I change the log channel later?**

Of course! You can modify the log channel at any time using the `/settings` command.
